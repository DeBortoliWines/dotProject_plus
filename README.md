# dotProject+ ("plus")
This is an unofficial dotProject+ repository, built predominantly for the purpose
of identifying how the current release differs from [dotProject](https://github.com/dotproject/dotProject) core.

dotProject+ aligns dP core with PMBOK and CMMI-DEV guidelines/methodologies for Project Management.

## Goals for this fork
dotProject+ has made some significant core changes, and module additions to dotProject core codebase.
De Bortoli Wines in conjunction with Adam Donnison/dotProject developer(s), Rafael Queiroz Goncalves/dotProject+ developer(s), and 2pi Software, are hoping to merge/integrate each standalone dotProject+ module into dotProject core (where appropriate/possible)

In all cases, the intention is to work with the dotProject developers to make the fixes/features palatable for acceptance into the core project.

## Repository Outline
Branches: 
* master - essentially a fully functional/clean implementation of dotproject_plus. Forked from dotProject core, merged with all the (sanitised) features from the dotProject_plus codebase release on sourceforge.
* dotproject_plus - development branch, issues and bug fixes are implemented here
